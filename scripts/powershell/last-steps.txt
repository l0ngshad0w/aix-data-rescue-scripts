6) Sanity checks & gotchas (based on your earlier errors)

500.30 / app failed to start
Almost always the Hosting Bundle mismatch or missing runtime. Install the Hosting Bundle for your exact major SDK (e.g., .NET 8). Then iisreset.

“EnableRetryOnFailure” tip you saw earlier
We baked this into Program.cs via AddDbContextFactory so transient SQL hiccups won’t kill the app.

App pool CLR should be “No Managed Code.”
ASP.NET Core runs out-of-process behind IIS; the in-process CLR setting is not used for Core apps.

Permissions
Make sure IIS AppPool\ChurchAppPool has Modify on D:\ChurchApp\App\publish (the script sets this).

Port already in use
If 8080 collides, either stop the other binding or change $Port in provision-iis.ps1 and re-run.

SQL connection
We default to Server=localhost;Database=ChurchApp;Trusted_Connection=True;.... If your instance name is non-default, update the connection string (e.g., Server=localhost\SQLEXPRESS).

7) Optional: quick “Members” placeholder page

Just to prove routing works, drop a page in Pages/Members.razor:

@page "/members"
<h3>Members</h3>
<p>Members page placeholder.  Data wiring coming next.</p>


Run publish-and-recycle.ps1 and browse http://localhost:8080/members.
