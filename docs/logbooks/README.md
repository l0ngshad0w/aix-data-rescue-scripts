# 📂 Documentation – AIX Data Rescue

This folder contains project documentation, logbooks, and reference materials.  

## 📓 Logbooks
The **logbooks** track step-by-step progress, checklists, and updates for the AIX Schema & Extraction project.  

- **`.docx` version** → Richly formatted for screenshots, tables, and offline use.  
- **`.md` version** → Git-friendly, easier to review in pull requests and track changes over time.  

### Current Versions
- `/docs/logbooks/AIX_Schema_Extraction_Logbook_Table_Updated.docx`  
- `/docs/logbooks/AIX_Schema_Extraction_Logbook_Table_Updated.md`  

### Usage
- Update the **Word document** during working sessions (especially for screenshots and structured tables).  
- Export/convert to **Markdown** after major updates so changes are visible in Git diffs.  
- Commit both versions with date-based naming if multiple versions exist (e.g., `AIX_Logbook_v20250907.docx`).
